## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set

Some of the data you will need is in the 'data' folder. For this week, you will use the CSV of scraped tweets in the Cambridge area and plot them on a Leaflet map. Place this Leaflet 

### Instructions

For this Problem Set:

Customize your website on Github by using Leaflet and JavaScript to add a Leaflet map of Cambridge showing tweets you have scraped.

Using data from Boston, this Leaflet map should contain:

* At least 1 GeoJSON layer (ie Boston and Cambridge Neighborhoods)
* 1 CSV layer
* make one of the layers interactive (ie with a popup showing tweet ID or tweet time)
* 1 basemap tile layer (such as openstreetmap or Stamen)

On your website, get rid of the cat image, replace it with one of your own :)

### Deliverable

Place this map on your [username].github.io website and submit the URL to Stellar.

<strong>Bonus</strong> customize your website by adding some style.

1. Change the font
2. Style the GeoJSON so it is not the default symbols (blue markers/polygons) See the following for help with this: [Leaflet Symbolization](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/map-symbolization/)
2. Adjust the layout and size of the map and various elements
3. Use a template like [Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/) in your page customization
