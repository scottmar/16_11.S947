# Front End Environments
## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set

### Instructions

For this Problem Set:

Create a project webpage on your Github site that you can host visualizations on and share information and other items on your project. It is up to you how to structure it. One team member can set up a website in their account and others can commit and collaborate.

#### Some suggestions

Use a template like [Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/) in your page customization. The tutorial at this link shows you [how to get started with customizing Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/).

Develop a base level branding for your visualization project and team. On your website, change up the fonts, colors, and images to make it your own, or use an entirely different [bootstrap template](http://startbootstrap.com/).
