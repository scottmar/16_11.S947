## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set

Some of the data you will need is in the 'data' folder. For this week, you will use the CSV you created of scraped tweets in the Cambridge area in your data scraping PSET and plot them on a Leaflet map. Place this Leaflet map on your github web site.

### Instructions

For this Problem Set:

Customize your website on Github by using Leaflet and JavaScript to add a Leaflet map of Cambridge showing tweets you scraped a few weeks ago in class.

Using data from Boston, this Leaflet map should contain:

* At least 1 GeoJSON layer (ie Boston and Cambridge Neighborhoods)
* 1 CSV layer
* make one of the layers interactive (ie with a popup showing tweet ID or tweet time)
* 1 basemap tile layer (such as openstreetmap or Stamen)

### Bonus Exercise!

Explore the [Bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/) website. Locate and find one Bl.ock that you can set up on your site. **The Bl.ock you use doesn't have to be from the Bl.ock homepage (although it can be), feel free to search other Bl.ocks that you might find relevant to your project on Google and stand one up if you want.**

You don't need to do any customization or change data at this point, we will explore that in subsequent weeks. Stand up the Bl.ock you find on your website.
